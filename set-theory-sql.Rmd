Hi there. There is this interesting infographic which relates set theory to table joins in SQL.

One can treat a database table as a set with elements being information within a table.

The set $A$ refers to table $A$ and the set $B$ refers to table $B$.

**Left Join**

&nbsp;

A left join selects everything from $A$ including the intersection $A \cap B$. If the null part is TRUE then the intersection removed and the $A$ only part would be selected which is like $A - B = A \cap B^{c}$.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Right Join**

&nbsp;

It would be similar with the right join with $B$ where the intersection $A \cap B$ is selected as well. If the null part is TRUE then the intersection removed and the $A$ only part would be selected which is like $B - A = B \cap A^{c}$.

&nbsp;

**Inner Join**

&nbsp;

The SQL INNER JOIN portion of a query combined with select outputs the intersection $A \cap B$ of tables $A$ and $B$.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Full Outer Join**

&nbsp;

The FULL OUTER JOIN portion of the query take everything from table $A$, table $B$ and the intersection $A \cap B$. If the key in table $A$ and the key in table $B$ IS NULL then the intersection $A \cap B$ is removed.
