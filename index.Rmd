$$Y = \alpha \cdot \sin(X), \alpha = 0,0.1,0.2,...,3$$


#remove backslashes before ticks to get this to work. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
cool_function <- function(x, alpha) return(sin(alpha*x))
xs <- seq(0, pi*1.5, 0.005)
ys <- cool_function(xs, 1)
results <- data_frame(xs, ys, alpha = "1")
for(alpha in seq(0,3, 0.1)){
  results <- results %>% 
    bind_rows(data_frame(
      xs, 
      ys = cool_function(xs, alpha),
      alpha = as.character(alpha)
    ))
}
