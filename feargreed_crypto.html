<h2>## Fear &amp; Greed Crypto Index In R</h2>
<p>Hi there. In this post, I transfer crypto fear and greed index data into R. The website where I extract the data is from is <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The crypto fear and greed index is one indicator which gauges to sentiment of people in the crypto market. People in the crypto market can be very emotional. Greed tends to occur when the market is rising and people get FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Fear can occur when people panic and sell when there is bad news and sharp downturns in price.</p>
<p>Extreme fear in the market can be good buying opportunities.</p>
<p>Extreme greed in the market could mean that the market is due for a correction (drop in price).</p>

<h2>## Obtaining The Data:</h2>
<p>Start with loading these libraries into R. Use <code>install.packages('pkg_name')</code> if you need to install a certain package into R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load packages, use install.packages(&quot;rjson&quot;) to install rjson
library(httr)
library(plotly)
library(jsonlite)</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<pre class="r"><code># Reference: https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/#api

raw_content &lt;- httr::content(response)

fear_greed_data &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(rawToChar(response$content))

fear_greed_df &lt;- fear_greed_data$data

# Check fear and greed data with head():

<pre><code>##   value value_classification  timestamp time_until_update

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Changing Data Types</strong></p>
<p>The fear and greed index values are in a character format. Timestamps are in a character format as well. Both of these need to be converted into numeric values.</p>
<p>The numeric timestamps need to be converted into a date format. This is done with combining <code>as.POSIXct()</code> with <code>as.Date()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Convert into numeric for value and timestamp columns

fear_greed_df$value &lt;- as.numeric(fear_greed_df$value)
fear_greed_df$timestamp &lt;- as.numeric(fear_greed_df$timestamp)

# Convert timestamp into date format:
# Example: as.Date(as.POSIXct(1629763200, origin = &quot;1970-01-01&quot;))

fear_greed_df$timestamp &lt;- as.Date(as.POSIXct(fear_greed_df$timestamp, origin = &quot;1970-01-01&quot;))

<h2>## Bar Graph Of Fear &amp; Greed Indicator Counts</h2>
<p>Creating the bar graph for fear &amp; greed indicator counts is actually a bit involved. The <code>table()</code> function in R is used to obtain counts for each fear and greed indicator</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fg_counts &lt;- data.frame(table(fear_greed_df$value_classification))
fg_counts</code></pre>
<pre><code>##            Var1 Freq
## 1  Extreme Fear  302
## 2 Extreme Greed  171
## 3          Fear  450
## 4         Greed  261
## 5       Neutral  117</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Next, I rename the columns in the <code>fg_counts</code> dataframe. The <code>factor()</code> function is for ordering the fear and greed indicators. I have this order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme Fear (lowest numeric index number)</li>
<li>Fear</li>
<li>Neutral</li>
<li>Greed</li>
<li>Extreme Greed</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<pre class="r"><code># Change column names
colnames(fg_counts) &lt;- c(&#39;Label&#39;, &#39;Count&#39;)

# Reorder Categories (Extreme Fear to Extreme Greed):
fg_counts$Label &lt;- factor(fg_counts$Label, 
                          label = c(&quot;Extreme Fear&quot;, &quot;Fear&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot;, &quot;Greed&quot;, &quot;Extreme Greed&quot;))</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>The dataframe is ready to be used for the bar graph in plotly. I have added the count values as text at the top of the bars with <code>text = ~Count</code> and <code>textposition = 'auto'</code>.</p>
<p>Individual colours for the bars were included to this bargraph. This is done with the use of <code>marker =</code> with a list of colours. The colours are in the RGB format.</p>

<h2>## Pie Chart For Fear &amp; Greed Indicator Counts</h2>
<p>Developing the pie chart in R with plotly is not too difficult. Do specify the type as pie with <code>type = 'pie'</code>. To obtain percentages and counts make sure to have <code>textinfo = 'label+percent+value'</code>. From the documentation <a href="https://plotly.com/python/pie-charts/" class="uri">https://plotly.com/python/pie-charts/</a> they do not have this mentioned. I got lucky and guessed it right with <code>textinfo = 'label+percent+value'</code>.</p>
