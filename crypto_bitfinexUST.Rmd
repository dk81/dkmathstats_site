## Free Withdrawal Of TerraUSD (UST) On Bitfinex
---

Hi there. In this page, I would like to point out that withdrawal of TerraUSD (UST) is **free** on the Bitfinex exchange (at time of writing). Free as in no withdrawal fees. 

The contents of this page was also posted to a blog with some edits. Invest, trade and transfer funds at your own risk.

## Withdrawal Limits For TerraUSD (UST)
---

It is a bit annoying that the minimum withdrawal limits information is not really accessible. You would have to have more than 0 for a certain crypto on the exchange and check the minimum limit for that crypto. 

For TerraUSD (UST) the minimum withdrawal limit is 4.99176359 TERRAUST which is equivalent to 5USD.

When it comes to transferring UST to your Terra Station wallet, you do not need a Memo. Also you do not have to checkmark the `Add a note to this withdrawal for your records... `. It is enough to have the Terra Station address at the top of the Terra Station window and an amount of UST above 5USD. It is a good idea to do a small test transaction of just over 5UST to check that transferring funds from Bitfinex to Terra Station works.
