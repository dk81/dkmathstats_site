### The Area Of A Square
---

A square has 4 sides with equal length in each of the 4 sides. Also the square has 4 corners and at each corner two adjacent lines form a 90 degree angle.

The area of a square is the length multiplied by the width of a square. Since the length of a square is equal to the width of the square, we use \\(length \times length\\) or \\((length)^2\\). You can use \\(width \times width\\) or \\((width)^2\\) if you are using the width of the square.

#### Perfect Square Numbers
---

A square number is the product of a positive whole number multiplied by itself. One example of a square number is 64 as \\(8 \times 8 = 8^2 = 64\\). Other examples of perfect square numbers include 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49.

Here is a sample table of square numbers.


Integer  | Square Of The Integer
------------ | -------------
<center>1</center> | <center>1</center>
<center>2</center> | <center>4</center>
<center>3</center> | <center>9</center>
<center>4</center>| <center>16</center>
<center>5</center>| <center>25</center>
<center>6</center> | <center>36</center>
<center>7</center> | <center>49</center>
<center>8</center> | <center>64</center>

### Square Roots
---

To obtain a perfect square we multiply a positive whole number by itself. If we want to go from a perfect square and obtain that original whole number, the square root will be needed.

The square root works on non-negative numbers and is expressed as \\(\sqrt{x}\\). Sometimes \\(\sqrt{x}\\) is expressed as \\(x^{\frac{1}{2}}\\).

The sample table of square numbers with its square roots is shown below.

Perfect Square  | Square Root Integer
------------ | -------------
<center>1</center> | <center>1</center>
<center>4</center> | <center>2</center>
<center>9</center> | <center>3</center>
<center>16</center> | <center>4</center>
<center>25</center> | <center>5</center>
<center>36</center> | <center>6</center>
<center>49</center> | <center>7</center>
<center>64</center> | <center>8</center>
<center>81</center> | <center>9</center>
<center>100</center> | <center>10</center>
<center>121</center> | <center>11</center>
<center>144</center> | <center>12</center>

### Examples
---
Here are a few more examples of squares and square roots.

The square of \\(x\\) is \\(x^2\\), the square of \\(x^2\\) is \\(x^4\\). In general the square of \\(x^{a}\\) where the exponent \\(a\\) is a real number is \\(x^{2a}\\).

The square root of \\(^2\\) is \\(x\\) and the square root of \\(x^4\\) is \\(x^2\\). In general, the square root of \\(x^{a}\\) is \\(x^{a/2}\\) where \\(a\\) is a real number.
