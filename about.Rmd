This website contains material from my other [website](www.dkmathstats.com). Content from there will be transferred to here. I plan to discontinue my website hosting from the other website and use this website as my main one.

I can be e-mailed at `dku8691@protonmail.com` if you find typos, errors or if you have any questions. 

In addition, as I am job hunting in the Toronto area (as of August 2018) in search of statistics, data analyst and/or data science roles.
