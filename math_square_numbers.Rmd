### The Area Of A Square


A square has 4 sides with equal length in each of the 4 sides. Also the square has 4 corners and at each corner two adjacent lines form a 90 degree angle.

The area of a square is the length multiplied by the width of a square. Since the length of a square is equal to the width of the square, we use $length \times length$ or $(length)^2$. You can use $width \times width$ or $(width)^2$ if you are using the width of the square.

### Perfect Square Numbers


&nbsp;

A square number is the product of a positive whole number multiplied by itself. One example of a square number is 64 as $8 \times 8 = 8^2 = 64$. Other examples of perfect square numbers include 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49.

Here is a sample table of square numbers.

Integer | Perfect Square 
--- | --- 
1 | 1
2 | 4 
3 | 9 
4 | 16 
5 | 25
6 | 36
7 | 49
8 | 64
9 | 81
10 | 100

### Square Roots


&nbsp;

To obtain a perfect square we multiply a positive whole number by itself. If we want to go from a perfect square and obtain that original whole number, the square root will be needed.

The square root works on non-negative numbers and is expressed as $\sqrt{x}$. Sometimes $\sqrt{x}$ is expressed as $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$.

The sample table of square numbers with its square roots is shown below.

Perfect Square  | Square Root Integer
--- | ---
1 | 1
4 | 2
9 | 3
16 | 4
25 | 5
36 | 6
49| 7
64 | 8
81 | 9
100 | 10
121 | 11
144 | 12

### Examples

&nbsp;

Here are a few more examples of squares and square roots.

The square of $x$ is $x^2$, the square of $x^2$ is $x^4$. In general the square of $x^{a}$ where the exponent $a$ is a real number is $x^{2a}$.

The square root of $^2$ is $x$ and the square root of $x^4$ is $x^2$. In general, the square root of $x^{a}$ is $x^{a/2}$ where $a$ is a real number.
