Hello. Here is a short guide on factorials.

&nbsp;

## The Factorial

&nbsp;

Before going into the definition of factorials. Here are some examples of factorials.

&nbsp;

$3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 6$

$5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120$

&nbsp;

As you can see, a factorial is a compact way of expressing the multiplication of descending (or ascending) positive whole numbers.

With factorials, the general case is:

&nbsp;

$$n! = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times ... \times 1$$

&nbsp;

or

&nbsp;

$$n! = 1 \times 2 \times ... \times (n -1) \times n$$

&nbsp;

for $n = \{2, 3, 4, 5, ...\}$.

There are also some special cases with $1! = 1$ and $0! = 1$.

&nbsp;

## Division With Factorials

&nbsp;

You may encounter fractions with factorials in the numerator and in the denominator. Here are some examples.

&nbsp;

**Example One**

&nbsp;

$$\dfrac{4!}{2!} = \dfrac{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{2 \times 1} = 4 \times 3 = 12$$

&nbsp;

**Example Two**

&nbsp;

$$\dfrac{10!}{9!} = \dfrac{10 \times 9!}{9!} = 10$$

&nbsp;

**Example Three**

&nbsp;

$$\dfrac{8!}{4! \times 2!} = \dfrac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4!}{4! \times 2!} = \dfrac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 }{2} = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 840$$

&nbsp;

**Example Four**

&nbsp;

$$\dfrac{4! \times 5!}{6!} = \dfrac{4! \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{6 \times 5 \times 4!} = \dfrac{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{6} = \dfrac{24}{6} = 4$$
