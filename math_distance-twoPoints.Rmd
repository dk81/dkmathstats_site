# <u> The Distance Between Two Points </u>

&nbsp;

This topic is about the distance between two points in the two dimensional system.

---

Suppose we are given a point $A$ with the co-ordinate ($x_1$, $y_1$) and a point $B$ with the co-ordinate ($x_2$, $y_2$). We want to find the distance between point $A$ and point $B$.

The distance from point $A$ to point $B$ is:

&nbsp;

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

&nbsp;

This distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem with the $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ formula. $c$ is the longest side opposite to the right angle in the right angled triangle.)

Here is a diagram illustrating the geometric intuition behind the formula.

### Examples

&nbsp;

**Example One**

Given the point $A$ as (-1, 2) and $B$ as (3, 0), the distance between point $A$ and point $B$ is:

&nbsp;

$$d = \sqrt{(3 - (-1))^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(4)^2 + (- 2)^2} $$

$$d = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = \sqrt{4 \times 5} = 2 \sqrt{5}  $$

&nbsp;

**Example Two**

Suppose that the point $A$ is (-2, 10) and the point $B$ is (0, 4), the distance between point $A$ and point $B$ is:

&nbsp;

$$d = \sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + (4 - 10)^2} $$

$$d = \sqrt{(2)^2 + (- 6)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 36} = \sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{4} \sqrt{10} = 2 \sqrt{10}$$
