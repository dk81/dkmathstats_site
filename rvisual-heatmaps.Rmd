Hi. I have played around with heatmaps in R and the ggplot2 package. Here is what I have worked with.

### <u>Dataset One: Strength Of Thermonplastic Composite Experiment Results</u>

&nbsp;

This first dataset is a small dataset with 9 row (observations) and 3 columns (variables). This data is from an experiment to test the strength of a thermoplastic composite. The image below is a screenshot of the R documentation of this dataset.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The ggplot2 and faraway libraries are loaded into R.

&nbsp;

```{r}
# Heatmaps in R:

# References:
# http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-quick-correlation-matrix-heatmap-r-software-and-data-visualization
# R Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang (2012)

## First Dataset:

library(faraway); library(ggplot2)
```

&nbsp;

In the faraway package, this data is called composite. I save this data into a variable called compData. I also print out the contents of this table.

&nbsp;

```{r}
compData <- composite

# See the data (not very big):

compData
```

&nbsp;

The structure of the dataset can be found by using the `str()` function.

&nbsp;

```{r}
# Structure of the dataset:

str(compData)
```

&nbsp;

The lines of code and output consists of changing the column names (for capitalization) and check the summary of the data. The `summary()` function gives some key summary statistics such as mean, median, counts for factors and more.

&nbsp;

```{r}
# Fix column names:

colnames(compData) <- c("Strength", "Laser", "Tape")

# Summary of the dataset:

summary(compData)
```                 

&nbsp;

**A Basic Heatmap Plot**

&nbsp;

Creating a basic heatmap plot does not require much code. In the `aes()` part of `ggplot()`, I have x = Tape, y = Laser and the fill colours associated with Strength. The add-on function `geom_tile()` is needed to obtain the tiles/squares in the plot.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4} 
# Basic Heatmap Plot:

heatmap1 <- ggplot(compData, aes(x = Tape, y = Laser, fill = Strength)) + 
  geom_tile()

heatmap1
```

&nbsp;

**A Heatmap Plot With Labels And More Features**

&nbsp;

The heatmap plot still needs some adjustments. The labels could be fixed and a title needs to be added. The next lines of code will produce a more detailed heatmap plot.

&nbsp;

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5} 
# Heatmap Plot (Fixed With labels):

heatmap1 + scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Slow (6.42 m/s)", "Medium (13 m/s)", "Fast (27 m/s)")) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(midpoint = median(compData$Strength), mid="grey70", 
                      limits = c(min(compData$Strength), max(compData$Strength))) +
  labs(x = "\n Tape Speed", y = "Laser Power\n", 
       title = "Strength Of Thermoplastic Composite \n Experiment Results \n",
       fill = "Composite \n Strength \n") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(face="bold", colour="darkgreen", size = 12),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face="bold", colour="darkgreen", size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(face="bold", colour="brown", size = 10)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Tape, y = Laser, label = Strength), color = "black", 
            fontface = "bold", size = 5)
```

&nbsp;

**Some Notes**

* `scale_x_discrete()` with the labels argument can give labels such as Slow, Medium and Fast
* `scale_fill_gradient2()` allows for customization of the numbers in the scale legend
* `labs()` are for the x-axis, y-axis labels, the legend title and the title
* The `theme()` function allows for the visual customization of labels and titles.
* `geom_text()` allows for labels in each tile

### <u>Dataset Two: Treatment and Block Effects On Egg Production</u>

&nbsp;

This second dataset is about treatment and block effects on egg production. The full details can be found in the screenshot image below.

&nbsp;

<center>![doc2](./images/heatmap02.jpg)</center>

&nbsp;

I save the eggprod data into a variable called eggprod_data. Then I take a look at the data, its data structure and some summary statistics.

```{r}
## Second Dataset:

eggprod_data <- eggprod

# Look at the data:

eggprod_data


# Data structure:
 
str(eggprod_data)

# Summary of the data:

summary(eggprod_data)
```

&nbsp;

The column names can be renamed using `colnames()`.

&nbsp;

```{r}
# Rename column names:

colnames(eggprod_data) <- c("Treatment", "Block", "Eggs")
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**A Basic Heatmap Plot**

Here is a basic heatmap plot which describes this data.

&nbsp;

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4} 
# Basic Heatmap Plot:

heatmap2 <- ggplot(eggprod_data, aes(x = Treatment, y = Block, fill = Eggs)) + 
  geom_tile()

heatmap2
```

&nbsp;

Like in the first heatmap in the first dataset, more can be done in terms of labelling and visual details.

**An Updated Heatplot**

Here is the code and output for this updated heatplot with more labels and titles.

&nbsp;

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# Updated Heatmap Plot:

heatmap2 + scale_x_discrete(labels = c("E", "F", "O")) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(midpoint = median(eggprod_data$Eggs), mid ="grey70", 
                       limits = c(min(eggprod_data$Eggs), max(eggprod_data$Eggs))) +
  labs(x = "\n Treatment", y = "Block \n", fill = "Number Of Eggs \n",
       title = "Treatment And Block Effects \n On Egg Production \n") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, colour = "blue"), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(face="bold", colour="darkgreen", size = 12),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face="bold", colour="darkgreen", size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(face="bold", colour="brown", size = 10)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Treatment, y = Block, label = Eggs), color = "black", 
            fontface = "bold", size = 5)
```
