### Projects

&nbsp;

[Crypto Prices Dashboard With Crypto Fear & Greed Index](https://dkmathstats.shinyapps.io/cryptoPrices_R)

This interactive dashboard produced in R, RShiny and flexdashboard features crypto prices from Coinbase and Kraken. There is a crypto fear and greed index where the data is extracted from [alternative.me](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/). You can find available price data for many of the popular cryptocurrencies along with a good handful of altcoins.

&nbsp;

[Quandl Financial Data - Bitfinex Crypto Price Data](https://dkmathstats.shinyapps.io/quandl_financedata_app/)

In late July 2021, I have included a new section in my Quandl Financial Data RShiny app. This new section features crypto price data from the Bitfinex crypto exchange. The free datasets are from Quandl's website.

[Binance For Crypto Data & Candlestick Charts In Python](https://github.com/dk81/jupyterNotebook/blob/master/binance_crypto_data.ipynb)

The python-binance package along with mplfinance was used to obtain cryptocurrency information from Binance. A candlestick price chart for the BTCUSDT trading pair was produced. 

&nbsp;

[Kucoin Crypto Data & Candlestick Charts In Python](https://github.com/dk81/jupyterNotebook/blob/master/kucoin_crypto_python.ipynb)

This project is similar to the Binance crypto data project. The Kucoin crypto exchange API is used to connect to Python. Candlestick price charts are produced with the mplfinance Python library.

&nbsp;

[Coinbase Crypto Data In R & Candlestick Price Charts](./Rcoinbase_candlestickCharts.html)

This [reference page](https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/blog/how-to-download-coinbase-price-data-R.html) contains a nice script on extracting cryptocurrency data into R and writing the data into a `.csv` file. I wanted to go a few steps further by modifying the script for user input.

&nbsp;

[The `coinmarketcapr` Package In R For Crypto Data](./coinmarketcap_Rpage.html)

In this page, I explore the `coinmarketcapr` R package for obtaining crypto data. Note that I use the free API service.

&nbsp;

[Kraken Crypto Data Into R](./RKraken_cryptopriceCharts.html)

Like the Coinbase project in R, I obtain data from the Kraken exchange. I add a second plot for the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) measure.

&nbsp;

[Crypto Fear & Greed Index Data In R](./feargreed_crypto.html)

Using R to obtain fear and greed index data and plotting the index values over time in `plotly`.
